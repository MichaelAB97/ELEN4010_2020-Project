# Sprint 3 Retrospective
The method chosen for assigning values to user stories is random.
### 1. Stories for sprint 3
##User stories 
* As a user i want to be able to manage a house/group = 6
* As a user i want to be able to add and view transactions = 7
* Added firstName, lastName & mobile number entries on sign up page = 2
* As a user I want to be able to share house link for non-members to join the application. = 4
* As a user I want a good user interface = 3
* As a user i would like notes informing me about the new app = 1

**Total Value** **23**

**The velocity for Sprint 3: 23 - 0 = 23** 
# **The overall velocity is (10 + 30 + 23)/3 = 21**
